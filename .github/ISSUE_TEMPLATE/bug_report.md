🐛 **Found a bug ? Something wrong ?** 🐛

My checklist :
- [ ] Checked for existing issues : https://github.com/nliautaud/p01contact/issues
- [ ] Checked relevant output in debug mode :
    - For GetSimple : https://github.com/nliautaud/p01contact/wiki/GetSimple-plugin#debug
    - For PicoCMS : https://github.com/nliautaud/p01contact/wiki/Pico-CMS-plugin#debug
    - Or https://github.com/nliautaud/p01contact/wiki/Settings
- [ ] Described the issue with relevant details : what leads to it, what's my setup (CMS, server...), what's my version
